# Smart Contract Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the smart contracts used in the project. The goal is to ensure the security, functionality, and performance of the contracts before deployment. Testing will be conducted using Foundry and Hardhat, with GitHub Actions for automated test execution on every update.

## Testing Scope
The smart contract will be tested from multiple angles, including:
- **Functional correctness**: Ensuring all functions behave as expected.
- **Security**: Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, access control flaws).
- **Performance**: Measuring gas usage and optimizing expensive operations.

## Tools & Frameworks
- **Foundry**: A fast, Rust-based framework for smart contract testing.
- **Hardhat**: A JavaScript/TypeScript-based development environment for Ethereum.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating test execution on each code update.
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Used for deployment and testing in a real blockchain environment.

## Types of Tests
### 1. **Unit Tests**
- Each function will be tested in isolation.
- Expected inputs and edge cases will be covered.
- Example: Minting an NFT should assign ownership to the caller.

### 2. **Security Tests**
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Ensure the contract follows best practices to prevent attacks.
- **Access Control**: Verify that only authorized users can call restricted functions.
- **Integer Overflows/Underflows**: Ensure safe math operations.
- **Front-Running Risks**: Analyze potential exploits based on transaction ordering.

### 3. **Gas Optimization Tests**
- Measure the gas cost of each function.
- Identify and optimize expensive operations.
- Compare different implementations to minimize deployment and execution costs.

## Test Execution & Automation
### 1. **Running Tests Locally**
#### Foundry:
```sh
forge test --gas-report
```
#### Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```

### 2. **Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions**
A GitHub Actions workflow will be set up to automatically run tests on every push and pull request.
Example workflow:
```yaml
name: Smart Contract Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Foundry
        run: curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
      - name: Run Foundry tests
        run: forge test --gas-report
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Hardhat tests
        run: npx hardhat test
```

### 3. **Deploying to Sepolia for Live Testing**
After passing local and CI tests, contracts will be deployed to the Sepolia testnet.
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

## Test Coverage Goals
- 100% coverage on core functionalities.
- Security-focused tests to detect vulnerabilities.
- Performance benchmarking to ensure gas efficiency.

## Next Steps
- Implement fuzz testing with Foundry to test with random inputs.
- Set up additional stress testing to evaluate scalability.
- Monitor real-world interactions on Sepolia before mainnet deployment.

This document ensures a robust testing approach for the smart contracts, covering all critical aspects before release. ðŸš€
