# Marketplace Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the smart contract used for a decentralized application (dApp) designed to tokenize and trade audio samples. The smart contract leverages Ethereum standards to enable secure ownership, licensing, and resale of digital samples.

## Features
- **NFT Representation**: Each sample is represented as a unique NFT (ERC-721) or a semi-fungible token (ERC-1155).
- **Metadata Storage**: Metadata such as title, artist, duration, and BPM are stored on-chain or referenced via IPFS/Arweave.
- **Minting Mechanism**: Creators can mint samples, setting ownership and royalty distribution.
- **Royalty System**: Implementing ERC-2981 ensures the original creator receives royalties upon resale.
- **Marketplace Functionality**: Users can list, buy, and sell samples in a decentralized manner.
- **Licensing & Rental Options**: Enabling temporary usage rights or permanent transfers.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. **Token Standards**
The smart contract can be based on:
- **ERC-721**: Each sample is unique and can only have one owner.
- **ERC-1155**: A sample can have multiple editions with distinct ownership.

### 2. **Minting & Ownership**
- Creators call the `mintSample` function, specifying:
  - Audio file hash (stored on IPFS/Arweave)
  - Metadata (title, artist, license details)
  - Initial price (optional)
- The contract assigns the NFT to the creator.

### 3. **Buying & Selling**
- Users list their NFTs using `listForSale(tokenId, price)`.
- Interested buyers call `purchase(tokenId)`, transferring ownership.
- Payments are handled via smart contract escrow.

### 4. **Royalties & Revenue Sharing**
- The contract implements ERC-2981 to distribute a percentage of resale price to the creator.
- Supports multiple recipients for collaborative works.

### 5. **Licensing & Rentals**
- `licenseSample(tokenId, duration, fee)` enables time-bound access.
- Users can temporarily hold usage rights without transferring full ownership.

### 6. **Security Measures**
- **Access Control**: Only owners can modify or sell their NFTs.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Ensuring safe marketplace transactions.
- **On-Chain Verification**: Preventing duplicate listings.

## Available Functions

### `mintSample(string memory metadataURI, address creator, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`
Mints a new sample NFT, assigns it to the creator, and sets royalty percentage.

### `listForSale(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price)`
Allows an owner to list their NFT for sale at a specified price.

### `purchase(uint256 tokenId)`
Transfers ownership of the NFT to the buyer upon payment.

### `setRoyalty(uint256 tokenId, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`
Updates the royalty percentage for a given token.

### `licenseSample(uint256 tokenId, uint256 duration, uint256 fee)`
Grants temporary access rights to an NFT in exchange for a fee.

### `withdrawFunds()`
Allows the contract owner or sellers to withdraw accumulated payments.

### `getSampleMetadata(uint256 tokenId)`
Retrieves the metadata of a given sample NFT.

### `getRoyaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId)`
Returns the royalty percentage and recipient for a specific NFT.

### `isSampleForSale(uint256 tokenId)`
Checks if a sample NFT is currently listed for sale.

## Next Steps
- Deploy smart contract on a testnet (Goerli, Sepolia)
- Audit for security vulnerabilities
- Integrate governance for fee adjustments

This document serves as a foundation for the development and implementation of a decentralized sample marketplace. ðŸš€
