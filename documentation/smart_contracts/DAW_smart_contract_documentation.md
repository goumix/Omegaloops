# DAW Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the smart contract used for a decentralized Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The smart contract enables music producers and artists to collaborate, tokenize, and trade audio compositions in a transparent and secure manner.

## Features
- **Project Tokenization**: Each DAW project can be represented as an NFT (ERC-721) or a semi-fungible token (ERC-1155).
- **Metadata Storage**: Project details such as contributors, BPM, duration, and licensing information are stored on-chain or referenced via IPFS/Arweave.
- **Minting Mechanism**: Artists can mint DAW projects to register ownership and revenue sharing rules.
- **Royalty System**: Implementing ERC-2981 ensures that contributors receive a percentage of earnings from sales and usage.
- **Collaboration Management**: Supports multiple contributors with role-based access.
- **Marketplace Functionality**: Enables listing, selling, and licensing of DAW projects.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. **Token Standards**
The smart contract is based on:
- **ERC-721**: Each DAW project is unique and can have one primary owner.
- **ERC-1155**: Allows for multiple editions of the same DAW project.

### 2. **Minting & Ownership**
- Creators call the `mintProject` function, specifying:
  - Project metadata (IPFS/Arweave hash)
  - Contributors and their revenue share
  - License details
  - Initial price (optional)
- Ownership is assigned to the primary creator.

### 3. **Buying & Selling**
- Projects can be listed for sale using `listForSale(projectId, price)`.
- Buyers purchase a project by calling `purchase(projectId)`, transferring ownership.
- Payments are handled through a smart contract escrow mechanism.

### 4. **Royalties & Revenue Sharing**
- ERC-2981 is used to distribute a percentage of resale revenue to contributors.
- Supports multiple recipients for collaborative projects.

### 5. **Collaboration & Licensing**
- `grantAccess(projectId, collaborator, role)` allows controlled access for editing.
- `licenseProject(projectId, duration, fee)` enables temporary usage rights.

### 6. **Security Measures**
- **Access Control**: Ensures only authorized users can modify a project.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents marketplace exploits.
- **On-Chain Verification**: Avoids duplicate and unauthorized listings.

## Available Functions

### `mintProject(string memory metadataURI, address[] memory contributors, uint256[] memory shares, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`
Mints a new DAW project, assigns ownership, and sets revenue-sharing rules.

### `listForSale(uint256 projectId, uint256 price)`
Allows an owner to list a project for sale.

### `purchase(uint256 projectId)`
Transfers ownership of the project to the buyer upon payment.

### `setRoyalty(uint256 projectId, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`
Updates the royalty percentage for a given project.

### `licenseProject(uint256 projectId, uint256 duration, uint256 fee)`
Grants temporary access to a DAW project in exchange for a fee.

### `withdrawFunds()`
Allows the contract owner or contributors to withdraw accumulated payments.

### `getProjectMetadata(uint256 projectId)`
Retrieves metadata of a specific DAW project.

### `getRoyaltyInfo(uint256 projectId)`
Returns the royalty details of a project.

### `isProjectForSale(uint256 projectId)`
Checks if a DAW project is currently listed for sale.

## Next Steps
- Deploy smart contract on a testnet (Goerli, Sepolia)
- Conduct a security audit
- Develop governance mechanisms for adjusting platform fees
